# Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Transformers

The goal of this project is to design and develop a multimodal sentiment analysis system using Transformers for the task of Memotion Analysis. This will involve analyzing Internet memes, which are composed of both textual and visual data, and classifying them based on their sentiment, humor type, and offense level. The project will utilize state-of-the-art transformer models to perform sentiment classification, humor classification, and offense detection across multimodal inputs.
